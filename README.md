# Photo Recomposition Using Repeated Cropping #

## Introduction ##
Repeated cropping is used to enhance the aesthetic quality of a photograph in terms of image composition.  

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to dictate iterative image cropping in order to improve the image composition. This automatic cropping is able to follow speciÔ¨Åc composition guidelines, such as the rule of thirds and the salient object size. 

For more details regarding this technique, please refer to http://sunw.csail.mit.edu/abstract/CNN_based_Repeated.pdf
